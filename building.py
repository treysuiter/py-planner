# Practice: Urban Planner
# Setup
# mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/planner && cd $_
# touch building.py
# In this exercise, you are going to define your own Building type and create several instances of it to design your own virtual city. Create a class named Building in the building.py file and define the following fields, properties, and methods.

# Properties
# designer - It will hold your name.
# date_constructed - This will hold the exact time the building was created.
# owner - This will store the same of the person who owns the building.
# address
# stories
# Methods
# Define a construct() method. The method's logic should set the date_constructed field's value to datetime.datetime.now(). You will need to have import datetime at the top of your file.

# Define a purchase() method. The method should accept a single string argument of the name of the person purchasing a building. The method should take that string and assign it to the owner property.

# Constructor
# Define your __init__ method to accept two arguments

# address
# stories
# Once defined this way, you can send those values as parameters when you create each instance

#  eight_hundred_eighth = Building("800 8th Street", 12)
# Creating Your Buildings
# Create 5 building instances
# Have each one get purchased by a real estate magnate
# After purchased, construct each one
# Once all building are purchased and constructed, print the address, owner, stories, and date constructed to the terminal for each one.
# Example
# 800 8th Street was purchased by Bob Builder on 03/14/2018 and has 12 stories.
